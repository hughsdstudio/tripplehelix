            // Alina Triple Helix
            "Much of the literature on models frames them as representational objects, taken to be in some kind of formal relationship with their intended target systems.",
            "On these views, models are artifacts with certain purposes - centrally, as with history, to render the world intelligible.",
            "The triple helix is a figurative apparatus, hoping to grow our understanding on the basis of analogy.",
            "Seen from one perspective - peering-through the helix - one observes cycles. Seen from far away - peering-for the helix - one gets the impression of a line propagating in a given direction.",
            "This is a second moment of synthesis in the model, between the cyclical and linear pictures of world history.",
            "In beholding it, a first reference comes to mind, that of DNA. Helices and other extended chiral structures show up often in biology.",
            "If this is a geometry of heredity, so too could it be a geometry of history, for in a sense history is but the heredity of society.",
            "DNA itself is a record - it acts only through proxies, via transcription and translation.",
            "It is thus that historically-informed action may be conceived - first, by selecting the right sections of history from which to learn.",
            "RNA is volatile and short-lived. DNA needs to last until cell replication, with supplementary help of repair mechanisms.",
            "A triple structure might be construed as even more robust - This makes sense for histories, which should stand the test of time potentially over multiple lifetimes.",
            "One such means is mutation (drift), which manifests through errors in replication or repair, and thus can be conceived as processes that have to deal with repetition and trauma.",
            "This resonates with a view of history as a society's record of its traumas and its ongoing attempts to deal with them.",
            "Even if the code itself is retained, the actual winding, the geometry, is flexible and exposes or obscures things.",
            "So can we see in history how at different times certain events seem more or less imposing - though memory is preserved, it is nevertheless selective in its amplitude.",
            "Perhaps, as suggested by White, these are the classics that configure the mythos - our apparatus for interpreting history.",
            "The process to go from information to action is that of translation and transcription.",
            "In bacteria, whose genomes consist of RNA, smaller complimentary sequences are produced for the purpose of synthesis, thus exhibiting a sort of 'redundant translation'.",
            "The passage to DNA brings about a need for nonredundant translation, as well as a decoupling of translation and transcription.",
            "This type of model would not be of much interest to historiography, for the strands we wish to study are, though correlated, not meant to be redundant.",
            "It might be more fruitful instead to think of a system of multiple complementarity.",
            "This also means that there are multiple versions of the same triple helix, depending on the local presence of left-wards or right-wards binding.",
            "This enables a form of pluralism of historical information storage.",
            "Perhaps, further analogy can be extracted here - swerves in political tendencies towards the left or the right can be analyzed as the implementation of the connections of the society strand.",
            "In analyzing emerging technologies in this frame, we may ask, for instance, how genome sequencing reveals and confounds notions of kinship.",
            "So may a technological analysis of history disturb notions of community and culture by transforming narratives into mere data.",
            "AI can also produce significant advances in forecasting. As we see with AlphaFold, which can predict with great accuracy the final geometry of complex protein structures.",
            "Models that anticipate the coiling of the triple helix amplify its capacity to anticipate itself - this might lead to new emerging dynamics as expectation further feeds back into action.",
            "A virus is an alien entity that inserts itself into the locus of genetic information storage and hijacks the molecular machinery towards its own ends.",
            "This might resonate with the recent analysis put forward in the book of Exocapitalism - can we see capitalism as a historical virus?",
            "Furthermore, fragments of ancient viral DNA still reside in our genome - have there been other such entities that have hijacked history in the past?",
            "There is also another alien entity that stores a separate genome inside eukaryotic cells - the Mitochondria.",
            "With a smaller size and inherited always through the maternal line, perhaps this gives us a way of thinking of parallel histories, suppressed by the dominant ones.",
            "Such might be the histories of oppressed groups, whose contributions have largely been erased from history.",
            "Light, for instance, coils around in a helical pattern when circularly polarized.",
            "Unfortunately, due to the particular coupling of the electric and magnetic fields, both coil in the same direction, and one simply is a staggered or delayed image of the other.",
            "This quantum case might be of interest because the notion of conjugate variables naturally emerges.",
            "It also allows for non-locality, which might be of increasing interest in our highly-mediated world, where it is not uncommon for network effects to produce couplings between things happening in opposite sides of the world.",
            "While DNA stores genetic information, waves (of any kind) store information too in the form of energy.",
            "The most striking example is how the light of distant stars gives us a glimpse into the past, all the way down to the cosmic microwave background.",
            "Funnily enough, circularly polarized light is not very common as a natural occurrence. You will most often see it in association with biology.",
            "There is another example of circularly polarized light that bewilders the gaze - the northern lights, aurora borealis.",
            "Perhaps, these can be seen as part of the aesthetic component of history, of how it not only orients us but can also disorient us, create an impression of awe and wonder.",
            "If DNA gave us a grammar for hereditary constraint and light sketched a topology of coupling and interference, the steam engine offers a pedagogy of conversion.",
            "It is the machine that makes explicit what the helix must always already do: take a difference—a gradient, a surplus, a pressure—and fold it through a sequence of mediations until it appears as work.",
            "Heat becomes motion only by passing through a disciplined choreography of valves, pistons, governors, and flywheels.",
            "Likewise, historical energies—geological stores, symbolic intensities, collective affects—do not 'act' until institutions, techniques, and norms canalize them into reproducible sequences.",
            "The steam engine is thus an allegory of the triple helix understood as thermodynamic governance.",
            "Begin with the gradient. Nature supplies the asymmetry (coal seams; forests; river routes; atmospheric differentials; human bodies with caloric limits).",
            "Technology scripts a cycle for exploiting it (boiler, cylinder, condenser). Society decides what counts as 'useful work'.",
            "Already the helix is visible: N shapes the outer bounds of feasible conversions, T encodes the steps by which conversion occurs, S selects ends and distributes costs.",
            "The crucial lesson is not that heat becomes motion, but that no conversion is free.",
            "Entropy is not an afterthought: waste heat is constitutive. Each historical advance generates its externalities.",
            "The helix advances by spending itself.",
            "The steam governor concentrates the cybernetic moment. A simple feedback device, it throttles fuel when rotation exceeds a setpoint, preventing runaway and collapse.",
            "Here the analogy is almost embarrassingly apt: norms, laws, and mores perform the governor's function—stabilizing oscillations, damping euphorias, preventing the system from shredding itself on its own accelerants.",
            "But the governor also introduces lag and overshoot. It never coincides with the process it regulates; it reacts.",
            "That delay—neither pure control nor pure spontaneity—maps onto the temporal structure of reform movements, regulatory regimes, and countercultures.",

            "Coupled with a pressing economic crisis that demanded a novel solution.",
            "For nearly two millennia, Western science had been dominated by the Aristotelian principle of horror vacui—the idea that 'nature abhors a vacuum'.",
            "This view held that a vacuum was a logical impossibility and that air was an ethereal element without weight.",
            "The steam engine only became conceivable after this paradigm was decisively overturned by the new experimental science of the 17th century.",

            "Reliably draining mines and enabling the extraction of the coal that would fuel the next stage of industrialization.",
            "For over 60 years, the Newcomen atmospheric engine was the undisputed workhorse of the industrial world.",
            "The next great leap in steam technology required a shift from empirical craft to scientific analysis.",
            "This transition was embodied by James Watt, a mathematical instrument maker at the University of Glasgow.",
            "In 1764, Watt was given the task of repairing a scale model of a Newcomen engine belonging to the university.",
            "He was struck by its profound inefficiency, observing that the cylinder consumed several times its own volume in steam with each cycle.",
            "He correctly identified the fundamental flaw: the repeated heating and cooling of the cylinder itself.",
            "Watt's analysis was informed by his association with the chemist Joseph Black and Black's recent discovery of the principle of latent heat.",
            "The theory of latent heat explained that a large amount of thermal energy is absorbed or released during a phase change without any change in temperature.",
            "This provided the theoretical framework for understanding the enormous quantity of heat being wasted in the Newcomen cycle.",
            "Watt realized that to make the engine efficient, 'it was necessary that the cylinder was always as hot as the steam that entered it'.",
            "His solution, which came to him in a moment of insight during a Sunday walk in 1765, was the separate condenser.",
            "Watt's brilliant idea was to perform the condensation not inside the working cylinder, but in a separate, connected vessel that could be kept permanently cool.",
            "This single invention, patented in 1769, was the greatest single improvement ever made to the steam engine.",
            "It increased the engine's thermal efficiency nearly fourfold, saving approximately 75% of the fuel cost compared to an equivalent Newcomen engine.",
            "This dramatic gain in efficiency was the key that unlocked the steam engine's potential.",
            "It was no longer economically confined to coal mines where fuel was cheap; it could now be profitably deployed anywhere.",
            "This final innovation transformed the steam engine from a specialized water pump into a universal prime mover.",
            "Capable of driving the machinery of the burgeoning Industrial Revolution.",
            "The evolution from Newcomen to Watt represents a profound shift in engineering philosophy.",
            "The Newcomen engine is a simple, brute-force machine governed by a single control input—the injection of water.",
            "The Watt engine, by contrast, is a complex, managed system.",
            "This transition from a simple cycle to a sophisticated, self-regulating system of control is a microcosm of the broader transformation of the Industrial Revolution itself.",
            "A move from the mere application of power to the systematic management of industrial processes for maximum efficiency and profit.",
            "Watt was not just an inventor; he was one of the world's first true systems engineers.",
            "In a profound reversal of the modern paradigm where scientific discovery typically precedes technological application, the steam engine stands as a paramount example of technology creating a new field of science.",
            "The engine, a product of decades of empirical tinkering and craft-based engineering, became the central object of study that gave rise to the science of thermodynamics.",
            "The practical quest to understand and optimize this machine led directly to the discovery of some of the most fundamental laws of nature.",
            "Carnot's genius was to abstract the real-world engine into an idealized theoretical cycle—the 'Carnot Cycle'.",
            "And to propose a powerful analogy. He argued that a heat engine functions like a water wheel.",
            "Just as a water wheel derives mechanical work from water falling from a high elevation to a low one, a heat engine derives work from heat 'falling' from a high temperature to a low temperature.",
            "Furthermore, the steam engine forced a revolution in the very concept of 'work' and 'energy.'",
            "Before the engine, energy was primarily understood in mechanical terms—the visible motion of objects or their position in a gravitational field.",
            "The steam engine presented a new, more mysterious transformation: the chemical energy in coal was converted into invisible heat, which in turn was converted into powerful, visible, mechanical work.",
            "For the philosopher and economist Karl Marx, the steam engine was the ultimate physical embodiment of the capitalist mode of production.",
            "He saw it not as a neutral instrument of human progress, but as a revolutionary weapon in the class struggle.",
            "A machine that fundamentally transformed social relations, intensified the exploitation of labor, and laid bare the inherent contradictions of capital.",
            "In Das Kapital, Marx argued that the primary purpose of machinery under capitalism is not to lighten the worker's load but to increase the production of 'surplus-value.'",
            "By dramatically increasing labor productivity, the machine shortens the portion of the workday the laborer needs to produce the value of their own wages.",
            "Thereby lengthening the portion they work for free for the capitalist.",
            "The relentless, non-biological rhythm of the steam engine dictates the pace of the entire factory.",
            "The worker, once a skilled artisan in control of their tools, is reduced to a mere 'attendant' of the machine.",
            "Performing repetitive, monotonous tasks in time with its movements.",
            "By replacing the need for muscular strength, the engine allowed capitalists to draw women and children into the factory workforce.",
            "This flooded the labor market, depressing the wages of adult male workers and bringing every member of the family under the direct control of capital.",
            "Just as the steam engine provided a new model for understanding society and the cosmos, it also offered a powerful paradigm for the inner world of the human mind.",
            "The dominant technology of the 19th century—the steam engine and its underlying science of thermodynamics—provided Sigmund Freud with a pervasive and structuring metaphor for his revolutionary model of the human psyche.",
            "The Freudian mind, in its architecture and dynamics, is a psychodynamic steam engine.",
            "Freud conceived of the psyche not as a spiritual entity but as a psychic 'apparatus,' a system for managing, channeling, and transforming energy.",
            "This 'economic' model is a direct metaphorical application of the principles of thermodynamics that emerged from the study of steam engines.",
            "Libido is a quantifiable, mobile energy that flows through the psychic apparatus.",
            "It can be invested in objects or ideas, blocked, or transformed, but like energy in a closed thermodynamic system, it can neither be created nor destroyed.",
            "The Id is the boiler, the primitive, unconscious source of instinctual drives and raw libidinal energy that constantly generates pressure.",
            "The Ego is the engine's complex regulating machinery—the valves, pistons, and governor—which attempts to manage the Id's powerful pressures.",
            "And release them in ways that are compatible with the demands of external reality.",
            "When the Ego deems an impulse from the Id to be unacceptable, it engages in 'repression'—it blocks the valve and bottles up the psychic pressure.",
            "This repressed energy does not vanish. Like steam in a sealed boiler, the pressure builds until it finds an alternative outlet.",
            "'Exploding elsewhere as a neurotic symptom' that the conscious mind cannot understand.",
            "The goal of psychoanalysis is catharsis—the safe release of pent-up emotional energy.",
            "The therapist acts as a kind of psychic engineer or 'technician-mechanic,' helping the patient, whose mind is a 'broken' machine.",
            "To identify the sources of pressure and open the appropriate valves, making the unconscious conscious and relieving the symptomatic tension.",
            "Beyond its influence on specific scientific and philosophical theories, the steam engine became the supreme icon of the 19th-century's defining ideology: the idea of Progress.",
            "It was tangible, noisy, and powerful proof of humanity's capacity for seemingly limitless technological and social advancement.",
            "It embodied a new and dominant relationship with nature, time, and space that fueled the optimistic spirit of the age.",
            "For centuries, human productivity had been tethered to the limits of muscle, wind, and water.",
            "The steam engine represented a final liberation from these natural constraints.",
            "It was hailed as the 'most valuable present which the arts of life have ever received from the philosopher,' a testament to human reason's ability to harness the fundamental forces of nature.",
            "When applied to transportation, the engine radically reshaped human experience.",
            "The steam locomotive and the steamship collapsed geography, making travel and trade faster, cheaper, and more reliable than ever before.",
            "This created a 'tightly integrated world economy' and fostered a sense of a shrinking, more connected globe.",
            "The engine was the visible driver of unprecedented economic and social transformation.",
            "By enabling the factory system, it created new forms of wealth, spurred the growth of a new industrial middle class.",
            "And fundamentally reordered society, pulling populations from the countryside into new, sprawling industrial cities built around factories rather than rivers.",
            "The steam engine created a powerful positive feedback loop of technological advancement.",
            "Better engines enabled the mining of more coal, which provided cheaper fuel for more engines.",
            "They powered more precise metalworking tools, which were then used to build stronger and more efficient engines.",
            "This accelerating, self-reinforcing cycle of improvement—where each innovation created the conditions for the next—became synonymous with the very idea of progress itself.",
            "However, the engine's role as a symbol of progress was profoundly double-edged.",
            "While it fueled utopian optimism about a future of abundance and human mastery, its dark consequences simultaneously gave rise to the 19th century's most powerful counter-narratives.",
            "The brutal exploitation in factories, the squalor of industrial slums, and the blackening of the skies with coal smoke.",
            "The Romantic movement, with figures like Thomas Carlyle denouncing the 'steam-powered mechanization of the mind,' was a direct reaction against the perceived soullessness of the industrial age.",
            "And as has been shown, Marx's entire critique of capitalism was a response to the new forms of alienation and exploitation made possible by the factory system that the steam engine created.",
            "The steam engine, therefore, did not create a simple, monolithic idea of progress.",
            "Instead, it created a profound societal and intellectual schism.",
            "It was the central object around which the great debates of modernity were fought: capital versus labor, industry versus nature, progress versus tradition.",
            "It powered both the utopian dreams and the dystopian critiques of the modern age.",

            "Under which circumstances do we declare a historical rupture, where such rupture is understood not as an event so shocking and unexpected that history's course suddenly changes, but as a shift in the mode in which its products - nature, technology and society - condition each other?",
            "Where the subsequent events are generated according to a new pattern and represent the nexus of a different type of relation between nature, technology and society?",

            // Murilo Netto - Freud, Lacan and the Machine
            "During his lifetime, René Descartes proposed a whole array of new ideas that, whether truly novel or 'merely' reframings of older ones, nevertheless secured him an important place in the pantheon of the thinkers who launched Europe into modernity.",
            "Among these ideas is a mind/body dualism that would echo in Western thought throughout the centuries: that between the thinking mind and the material body as totally distinct types of substances.",
            "Descartes thus presented his contemporaries with a purely mechanical conception of the animal body, according to which an animal, devoid of a thinking mind, is nothing more than an automaton, a machine made of organic matter.",
            "Modern philosophy, according to the psychoanalyst, developed around the idea of 'the identification of man with his knowledge'.",
            "While on the side of modern medicine '[t]he physician has with respect to the body the attitude of the man who dismantles a machine'.",
            "This is precisely the context in which Lacan locates Freud as a turning point: psychoanalysis is born as an attempt to address the philosophical question from a physician's point of view.",
            "This is clearest in Freud's first attempt at a theoretical work, his 1895 Project for a Scientific Psychology.",
            "In which the father of psychoanalysis tries to account for the genesis and structure of the human mind in a way that dispenses with any reliance on subjectivist descriptions.",
            "To the point that it could even be mapped onto a mathematical model.",
            "After all, Freud was not the first to propose an a-subjective description of the development and the workings of the mind.",
            "As Lacan rightfully points out, he was preceded by a kind of radical empiricism best represented by Condillac's Traité des Sensations.",
            "In which the the Enlightenment thinker proposed a model according to which, says Lacan, 'the scent of the rose seems a very solid starting point, out of which the entire psychic edifice has to be drawn, without any apparent difficulty, like a rabbit from a hat'.",
            "In other words, Condillac radicalizes Locke's tabula rasa by theorizing the way in which, from simple direct interactions with the sensible word, the mind literally comes into being.",
            "The difference between Condillac and Freud, notices Lacan, is that 'For Condillac, as for others, more comes out than was put in. They were metaphysicians.'",
            "'At some point it was realised that to draw the rabbit out of the hat you always have to have put it in beforehand. That is the principle of energetics, and that is why energetics is also a metaphysics'.",
            "If there already were precursors to the endeavor of thinking the structure of the mind from a mechanical standpoint, what enabled Freud to come up with a new version of the same concept?",
            "Or, in other words, why didn't Condillac come up with the idea of the pleasure principle?",
            "The answer, for Lacan, is as intriguing as it is provocative: 'Because [...] he didn't have a formula for it, because he came before the steam engine.",
            "The era of the steam engine, its industrial exploitation, and administrative projects and balance-sheets, were needed, for us to ask the question—what does a machine yield?'",
            "While the machine in Descartes' mind was a clock, the machine in the mind of modern biologists, notes Lacan, is the homeostat.",
            "A machine capable of adjusting itself to the environment by means of an energetic economy; and it is from this conceptual terrain that Freud launches himself into the quest for the subject.",
            "'Freud's whole discussion revolves around that question, what, in terms of energy, is the psyche?'",
            "Lacan himself, however, was writing at a historical moment when the rapid development of the formal sciences was reshaping the way we understood science.",
            "And if psychoanalysis, as the French thinker maintained, stems from scientific thought, then the way scientific discourse determines the way we think about ourselves also had to change.",
            "A prime example of this overcoming of the 19th-century scientific worldview is in Lacan's rejection of the energetic model of the psyche in favor of a new concept of the machine.",
            "'If we know how to reveal the meaning of this energy myth, we see the emergence of what was, from the start and without it being understood, implicit in the metaphor of the human body as a machine. Here we see the manifestation of a certain beyond of the inter-human reference, which is in all strictness the symbolic beyond.'",
            "This time, machines are conceptualized through their relation to cybernetics—that is, as means of computing and processing information.",
            "While the homeostats that shaped Freud's imagination were themselves cybernetic systems, the early-20-century advent of the formal sciences revealed that transposing the idea of a machine to different kinds of systems was no mere analogy: the machine is the relational process at play.",
            "During this period, concepts previously thought to be empirical were formalized.",
            "With information theory, for example, we discovered that entropy is not a thermodynamical concept, but a statistical one that was merely discovered in the context of thermodynamics.",
            "Similarly, the suggestion of conceptualizing the unconscious as a machine no longer required, as it did for Freud, for us to speak of it in terms of an energetic system.",
            "As if it was composed of elements akin to those of a homeostatic steam engine—its machinic aspect is, after all, simply the way information is structurally dealt with in order to keep the stability and functioning of the system.",
            "In this way, Lacan, along with Claude Lévi-Strauss, was able to see that what we call the unconscious concerns the living dynamic of language itself, and that language can be thought of as a literal machine.",
            "The transposal of this new definition of the machine onto the machinic Freudian pleasure principle by Lacan is evident in how, for example, in The Instance of the Letter in the Unconscious, he interprets the primary processes of condensation and displacement as the linguistic operations of metaphor and metonymy.",
            "From this point on, the pleasure principle is no longer about lowering the levels of psychic energy, but about the incorporation of new information into an unconscious body of signifying chains.",
            "The shaping of theory through technology takes another turn with the notion of the Virtual Machine.",
            "Aaron Sloman points out how the development of software engineering provided us with concrete examples that can be used to build a new model of the mind.",
            "One that avoids both metaphysical reliance on immaterial entities and physicalist reductionism.",
            "The virtual machine is a kind of information-processing system that emerges from physical conditions in such a way that its features cannot be mirrored onto the physical machine it supervenes upon.",
            "Making it so that the relations between the physical processes that sustain the information processing of the virtual machine can only be intelligible through descriptions that rely on the vocabulary of the virtual machine itself.",
            "Just as even the most thorough description of the physical relations of causation at play in a game of chess cannot give any sufficient reason for those sequences of events, requiring us to use the vocabulary of chess.",
            "So does a virtual machine such as an email system, for example, operates in ways that cannot be made sense of even with the most complete description of the workings of the physical aspect of the devices connected to this email system.",
            "According to Sloman, we must think of the mind-brain relationship in the same way.",
            "Elaborating from Sloman's work, Reza Negarestani links this way of thinking about the nature of intelligence to the Hegelian concept of Geist in order to show that the individual must be thought of as an instantiation of a larger communal structure.",
            "Individuated by the recognition relations that this larger working structure, this virtual machine, is composed of.",
            "Is this not precisely what Lacan was working toward at the dawn of cybernetics and of computer science?",
            "Just as the steam engine shaped Freud's understanding of the human mind, we see now how the technology of the information age updates, in Negaretani's work, our understanding of the same object yet again.",
            "The picture we're left with, then, is that of the historical interplay between the ways technology shapes the way we conceive of nature and ourselves.",
            "With Freud and the biologists influenced by the homeostats; the way the theoretical work developed in this era, sprouted from a machinic conception of the world, helps reshape the world and technology itself, birthing the information age.",
            "And finally, how this new technological and societal paradigm reshapes yet again the way we think about nature and about ourselves.",
            "As seen in the works of Sloman and Negarestani, where the Virtual Machine Functionalism already somewhat anticipated by Lacan is once again put forward.",
            "This time not only in the context of theory, but in light of the concrete world this theory helped shape.",
            "The interplay between Nature, Technology and Society shapes history everywhere—not just in politics, but in the history of our very ideas."
